# huffman-encryption-encoder

====== HOW THIS ENCODER WORKS ======
 - enter the message you want to encode, but replace spaces with underscores
 - the encoder will tell you the frequency of each letter, their corresponding code, and the encoded message
 
====== NOTES ABOUT USING THIS ======
My program isn't fool proof, so some types of inputs will cause it to not encypt the message correctly. I might fix the following issues, but for now, try to not:
 1. have spaces in your input message
 2. special characters that do not exist in the ascii table (since i can't assign those values to a char)
      - here is a table of valid ASCII values: https://www.asciitable.com/
